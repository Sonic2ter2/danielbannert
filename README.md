# My personal Portfolio

## Installation

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) and [vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for all its internal build processes. In theory, this project requires at lest Node v20 to run.

## Quick Commands

-   `pnpm dev` - Run the development server
-   `pnpm run build` - Builds the portfolio into a `html` file
-   `pnpm run build:github-list` - Generates a list of all the GitHub repos in the portfolio

## Supported Node.js Versions

Libraries in this ecosystem make the best effort to track
[Node.js’ release schedule](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). Here’s [a
post on why we think this is important](https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/maintainers-should-consider-following-node-js-release-schedule-ab08ed4de71a).
